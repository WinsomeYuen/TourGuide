# TourGuide
A tour guide app for London showing restaurants, museums, activities and events. What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

* Planning your app design and navigation before coding
* Selecting proper data structures to store lists of information
* Building layouts to display those lists of data
* Navigating between lists in Fragments using either a ViewPager plus TabLayout
* Creating your own custom classes
* Properly handling images
